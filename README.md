- Uses TypeScript and Three.js to build a 3D graphics program
- Draws simple 3D geometries
- Work effectively with 3D points, vectors, and other "graphics math"
- Balance the tradeoffs between realism and effective game play by simulating physics in a "plausible" but not necessarily 100% realistic way


## Getting Started

The starter code implements the general structure that we reviewed in lecture.  After cloning your repository, you will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
npm run start
```



Webpack should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
